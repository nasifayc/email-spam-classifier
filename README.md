## üöÄ Features

- Loads and processes email text data.
- Uses TF-IDF to convert email content into numerical features.
- Trains a logistic regression model to classify emails.
- Predicts and evaluates accuracy on both training and test data.
- Allows for testing custom email messages.

## üìÅ Dataset

The dataset used should be a CSV file named `mail_data.csv` with at least the following columns:

> | Category | Message |
> |----------|---------|
> | ham | I'm going to be home soon. |
> | spam | Congratulations! You've won a prize! Click here... |

You can use public datasets from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) or the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html).
